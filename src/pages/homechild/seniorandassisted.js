          An assisted living residence or assisted living facility (ALF) is a
          housing facility for people with disabilities or for adults who cannot
          or who choose not to live independently. The term is popular in the
          United States, but the setting is similar to a retirement home, in the
          sense that facilities provide a group living environment and typically
          cater to an older adult population
